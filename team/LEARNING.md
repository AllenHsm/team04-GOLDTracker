### Lists the background (incoming knowledge and interests) for each team member, and will document the progress over the quarter.

June Bi: I have took the CS148 and made a mobile IOS app for UCSB students to sell their second-handed items. We use Expo as the framework, design the UI/UX with Figma, and use Firebase as the database.

Karsten Lansing: I have taken CS156 in which I worked with React through a SCURM framework. Most of my experience is in C++ and Python.

Simon Mann: I have taken CS156 where I worked with React and programmed with Java and Javascript. I do have experience working with both C++ and Python as well. 

Allen Hu: I have taken CS156 too. Last summer I did some scraping using Python. Specifically, I used LLMs like ChatGpt and Claude to automatically generate scraping scripts and run them and ask LLM to review the result. I am looking forward to applying it in this project.
