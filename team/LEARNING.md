# Learning
### Lists the background (incoming knowledge and interests) for each team member, and will document the progress over the quarter.

**June Bi:** I have took the CS148 and made a mobile IOS app for UCSB students to sell their second-handed items. We use Expo as the framework, design the UI/UX with Figma, and use Firebase as the database.

**Karsten Lansing:** I have taken CS156 in which I worked with React through a SCURM framework. Most of my experience is in C++ and Python.

**Simon Mann:** I have taken CS156 where I worked with React and programmed with Java and Javascript. I do have experience working with both C++ and Python as well. 

**Allen Hu:** I have taken CS156 too. Last summer I did some scraping using Python. Specifically, I used LLMs like ChatGpt and Claude to automatically generate scraping scripts and run them and ask LLM to review the result. I am looking forward to applying it in this project. 

**Xinyao Song:** I have taken both CS148 and CS156, and I also have some experience with Unity 3D game development. I am very familiar with React Native. I enjoy working with front-end and UI design, but I am also somewhat experienced with back-end servers like Firebase.

**Daniel Jensen:** I've taken CS156, and have familiarity with spring boot, React, Java, and Javascript. I also have a good amount of knowledge in Python.

### Reflections of Our Platform(react-naive)
**June Bi:** The version of the platform is really small, so coders have to learning something frequently. The benefit of using it is that there are many resources you can easily find.

**Karsten Lansing:** 

**Simon Mann:** I have developed apps based on React Native before so the familiarity might be a benefit. However, I never tried to build a cross-platform mobile app so there can be some unforeseeable problems. 

**Allen Hu:** One benefit of using react native is that it is easy to learn and many of us have experiences in this platform. The biggest challenge for me is that, I have no experience in developing a complete mobile app based on react-native before. 

**Xinyao Song:** React native is a good choice when we want to do cross-platform mobile app development, while to combine the platform with back-end and database might be challenging. 

**Daniel Jensen:** I think it's beneficial that React-native presents an overall unified experience for creating apps for both ios and android -- you can have one codebase for both platforms. However, the negative is that at times it falls apart at the seams -- you have to generate project directories for both individual platforms and occasionally make changes -- which doesn't always give the unifying experience it seems.
