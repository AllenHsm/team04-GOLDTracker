June Bi: I have took the CS148 and made a mobile IOS app for UCSB students to sell their second-handed items. We use Expo as the framework, design the UI/UX with Figma, and use Firebase as the database.

Karsten Lansing: I have taken CS156 in which I worked with React through a SCURM framework. Most of my experience is in C++ and Python.
