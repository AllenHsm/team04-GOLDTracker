## Experiment: Unit Tests
Together with Xinyao, we wrote unit tests to cover the the `/components` directory for our project.
As you can see, they run and pass:

Previous to this, we had no tests at all and no indicators of when something changes, possibly having knock-on effects.


The individual tests can be seen in this directory:
