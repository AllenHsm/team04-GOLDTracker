Our team created the GitHub repository for the project, and added all of our teammates as collaborators.
We are performing the initial set-up as described in the [Sec01 assignment](https://ucsb.instructure.com/courses/22974/assignments/287222), which include:
1. List all roles in `team/LEADERSHIP.md`

3. Added `team/LEARNING.md` for all members
4. Reached consensus on `team/NORMS.md`
