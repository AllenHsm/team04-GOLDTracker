My name is Xinyao, a senior Computer Science major with a strong interest in front-end design and various video games. 
I became interested in this project because, back in my second year, my friend and I were both extremely excited to take 
CS156. However, since our registration time was a bit late, we couldn't get into the class during our first pass. Later, 
my friend stayed up late and realized there was an open spot, so they were lucky enough to join the class. Unfortunately, 
I wasn't able to find a free spot, even though I checked GOLD regularly each day during pass 1 and 2. I believe that with
an app like the one we are building, it would be much easier for students to get into the classes they want.
