## Introduction

I am a 4th year Computer Science major. I am primarily interested in cybersecrurity. Most of my experience is in C++ and Python. However, I do have some experience with React/Web development. A fun fact about me is that I am on the UCSB Roller Hockey team and I have pretty much played every variation of hockey there is.
